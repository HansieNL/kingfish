{"name":"Kingfish","tagline":"An open-source single-file HTML/JavaScript Hue controller","body":"### Kingfish for Philips Hue, by Peter Kaminski\r\n\r\nAn open-source single-file HTML/JavaScript Hue controller for\r\ninteracting directly with the API. Intended for those who want to get\r\na better handle on the low-level interface to their Hue system.\r\n\r\nYou can load the `kingfish.html` file from the repo, or load or save the file from the web:\r\n[kingfish.html](http://peterkaminski.github.io/kingfish/kingfish.html).\r\n\r\nHardware donations gratefully received, contact\r\n<kingfish@istori.com>. Consider purchasing [Hue\r\ncolor](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BSN8DN4/?tag=kfsh-20) or [Hue\r\nLux](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ME9CDQE/?tag=kfsh-20) gear via our\r\nAmazon associate links to help support the Kingfish project.\r\n\r\nCommands are sent on your local network directly from your device to\r\nyour Hue bridge, not through any server. (The \"Get Bridge IP\" command\r\nretrieves your bridge IP address from a Philips server, but does not\r\nsend any data, nor does the Philips server send any commands.) There\r\nare no analytics or tracking bugs in this file.\r\n\r\nStart by doing boxes in numbered order, then repeat in any order as\r\ndesired. Green buttons set blue values, but don't send commands. Blue\r\nand red buttons send commands to bridge. You can close and re-open\r\nKingfish at any time. Kingfish uses HTML5 local storage, if available\r\nin your browser, to persist input values entered on your device.\r\n\r\nRoadmap and other development ideas:\r\n\r\n* XY color\r\n* graphical color picker\r\n* Schedules and Rules\r\n* calendar/time picker\r\n* Scenes\r\n* using names of objects from bridge instead of numbers\r\n* more attractive visually (better CSS)\r\n* theming\r\n* namespacing variables\r\n* better code organization\r\n* automatic parsing of responses\r\n* countdown timer for monitoring transition time\r\n* active programmatic control of lighting\r\n* support for other similar systems\r\n\r\nKingfish uses [jQuery.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) to\r\nsend commands via HTTP to the bridge.
